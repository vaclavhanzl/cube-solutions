This is a 3D viewer used to show solutions of my [Evil Cube type puzzles](https://www.printables.com/model/1339793-evil-cube).
You can see it in action for example [here](https://vaclavhanzl.github.io/cube-solutions/cube.html?bricks=13,564,851,864,1108,1115,1310,1435,1519,1685,1868,2025).

More importantly, this is also my sandbox for experiments with 3D graphics in biochemistry using tools like Three.js, NGL and plotly.
